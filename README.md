# Hi There👋

This is my final project for the Dicoding course 'Belajar Analisa Data Dengan Python.' The project involves analyzing a bike-sharing dataset and creating a dashboard to present the findings.

# 1. File Structures

# 2. Cycle Project
1. Data Wrangling -> Gathering, assessing, and cleaning the data.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) -> Exploring the data to uncover patterns and insights.
3. Data Visualization -> Creating visualizations based on insights from the data.
4. Dashboard -> Building a dashboard to present the analyzed data and visualizations.

# 3. Getting Started
## notebook.ipynb
1. Download the project files.
2. Open Google Colab and create a new notebook.
3. Upload the .ipynb file and open it.
4. Connect to the hosted runtime in Colab.
5. Run the code cells to execute the analysis.

## dashboard/dashboard.py
1. Download the project files and keep them in one folder.
2. Install Streamlit and libraries -> pandas, seaborn, matplotlib. text like **pip install [name of library]** on your terminal
3. Keep the CSV file with dashboard.py
4. Run the dashboard in VSCode by typing **streamlit run dashboard.py**
